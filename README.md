# Dicer
Dicer is a Discord bot used to roll dices

The command is sent by the user with the "!roll" with "xdy" parametres, x being the number of dice and y the maximum value.
Dice's values are minimum equal to 0.

You can add or substract multiple dices like the following example: "!roll 2d3+1d5-2d2"
It's also possible to add or substract constants values like the following example: "!roll 1d100+5-12"
